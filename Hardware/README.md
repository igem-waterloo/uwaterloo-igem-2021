To upload the code to your board, you will need to download the Arduino IDE, found here: 
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Before uploading, do the following:
1. Select Tools > Board > Arduino Micro
2. Check Tools > Port and make sure you have the right port selected (if you have it plugged in, "Arduino Micro" should be beside the port name)
